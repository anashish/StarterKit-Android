# StarterKit-Android

StarterKit is Rx based project on MVVM design pattern using rxnetwork (https://github.com/git-jkumar/rxnetwork). The purpose of Starter-Kit is to create a baseline project based on Rx making it easier to develop project features/modules on top of it.

This is a first version of baseline project and feedback are invited for improving it further.
